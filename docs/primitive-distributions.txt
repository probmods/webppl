.. js:function:: Delta({v: ...})

  * v: support element *(any)*

  Discrete distribution that assigns probability one to the single element in its support. This is only useful in special circumstances as sampling from ``Delta({v: val})`` can be replaced with ``val`` itself. Furthermore, a ``Delta`` distribution parameterized by a random choice should not be used with MCMC based inference, as doing so produces incorrect results.

.. js:function:: DiagCovGaussian({mu: ..., sigma: ...})

  * mu: mean *(tensor)*
  * sigma: standard deviations *(tensor (0, Infinity))*

  A distribution over tensors in which each element is independent and Gaussian distributed, with its own mean and standard deviation. i.e. A multivariate Gaussian distribution with diagonal covariance matrix. The distribution is over tensors that have the same shape as the parameters ``mu`` and ``sigma``, which in turn must have the same shape as each other.

.. js:function:: Dirichlet({alpha: ...})

  * alpha: concentration *(vector (0, Infinity))*

  Distribution over probability vectors. If ``alpha`` has length ``d`` then the distribution is over probability vectors of length ``d``.

.. js:function:: KDE({data: ..., width: ...})

  * data: data array
  * width: kernel width

  A distribution based on a kernel density estimate of ``data``. A Gaussian kernel is used, and both real and vector valued data are supported. When the data are vector valued, ``width`` should be a vector specifying the kernel width for each dimension of the data. When ``width`` is omitted, Silverman's rule of thumb is used to select a kernel width. This rule assumes the data are approximately Gaussian distributed. When this assumption does not hold, a ``width`` should be specified in order to obtain sensible results.
