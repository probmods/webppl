Inference
=========

*Marginal inference* (or just *inference*) is the process of reifying
the distribution on return values implicitly represented by a
:ref:`stochastic computation<sample>`.

(In general, computing this distribution is intractable, so often the
goal is to compute an approximation to it.)

This is achieved in WebPPL using the ``Infer`` function, which takes a
function of zero arguments representing a stochastic computation and
returns the distribution on return values represented as a
:ref:`distribution object<distributions>`. For example::

   Infer({model: function() {
       return flip() + flip();
   }});

``Infer`` will perform inference using :ref:`enumeration<enumerate>`
by default, but several other implementations of marginal inference
are also built into WebPPL. Information about the individual methods
is available here:

Factor
------

The ``factor`` operator is a used *within* marginal inference to alter
the implicit distribution of a stochastic computation by arbitrarily
weighting particular executions.

Note that because ``factor`` *interacts* with inference, it cannot be
used outside of ``Infer``. Attempting to do so will produce an error.

Marginal inference is often used to perform Bayesian inference. In
this setting, the stochastic computation represents the prior, the
``factor`` operator is used to introduce observations, and marginal
inference computes the posterior distribution. This common pattern is
aided by the helper function ``condition``.
