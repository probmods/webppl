Methods
=======

.. _enumerate:

Enumeration
-----------

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'enumerate'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference by enumeration.

   The following options are supported:

   .. describe:: maxExecutions

      Maximum number of (complete) executions to enumerate.

      Default: ``Infinity``

   .. describe:: strategy

      The traversal strategy used to explore executions. Either
      ``'likelyFirst'``, ``'depthFirst'`` or ``'breadthFirst'``.

      Default: ``'likelyFirst'`` if ``maxExecutions`` is finite,
      ``'depthFirst'`` otherwise.

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'enumerate', maxExecutions: 10, model: model});
     Infer({method: 'enumerate', strategy: 'breadthFirst', model: model});

Rejection sampling
------------------

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'rejection'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference using rejection sampling.

   The following options are supported:

   .. describe:: samples

      The number of samples to take.

      Default: ``1``

   .. describe:: maxScore

      An upper bound on the total factor score per-execution.

      Default: ``0``

   .. describe:: incremental

      Enable incremental mode.

      Default: ``false``

   Incremental mode improves efficiency by rejecting samples before
   execution reaches the end of the program where possible. This
   requires every call to ``factor(score)`` in the program (across all
   possible executions) to have ``score <= 0``.

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'rejection', samples: 100, model: model});

MCMC
----

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'MCMC'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

   The following options are supported:

      .. describe:: samples

         The number of samples to take.

         Default: ``100``

      .. describe:: lag

         The number of additional iterations to perform between
         samples.

         Default: ``0``

      .. describe:: burn

         The number of additional iterations to perform before
         collecting samples.

         Default: ``0``

      .. describe:: kernel

         The transition kernel to use for inference. See `Kernels`_.

         Default: ``'MH'``

      .. describe:: verbose

         When ``true``, print the current iteration and acceptance
         ratio to the console during inference.

         Default: ``false``

      .. describe:: justSample

         When ``true``, maintain an array of all samples taken. This
         is available via the ``samples`` property of the returned
         marginal distribution. ``justSample`` implies ``onlyMAP``.

         Default: ``false``

      .. describe:: onlyMAP

         When ``true``, return a delta distribution on the sampled
         value with the highest score instead of a marginal
         distribution built from all samples.

         Default: ``false``

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'MCMC', samples: 1000, lag: 100, burn: 5, model: model});

Kernels
^^^^^^^

The following kernels are available:

.. describe:: MH

   Implements single site Metropolis-Hastings. [wingate11]_

   This kernel makes use of any :ref:`drift kernels <driftkernels>`
   specified in the model.

Example usage::

    Infer({method: 'MCMC', kernel: 'MH', model: model});

.. describe:: HMC

   Implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. [neal11]_

   As the HMC algorithm is only applicable to continuous variables,
   ``HMC`` is a cycle kernel which includes a MH step for discrete
   variables.

   The following options are supported:

   .. describe:: steps

      The number of steps to take per-iteration.

      Default: ``5``

   .. describe:: stepSize

      The size of each step.

      Default: ``0.1``

Example usage::

    Infer({method: 'MCMC', kernel: 'HMC', model: model});
    Infer({method: 'MCMC', kernel: {HMC: {steps: 10, stepSize: 1}}, model: model});

Incremental MH
--------------

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'incrementalMH'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference using C3. [ritchie15]_

   This method makes use of any :ref:`drift kernels <driftkernels>`
   specified in the model.

   The following options are supported:

      .. describe:: samples

         The number of samples to take.

         Default: ``100``

      .. describe:: lag

         The number of additional iterations to perform between
         samples.

         Default: ``0``

      .. describe:: burn

         The number of additional iterations to perform before
         collecting samples.

         Default: ``0``

      .. describe:: verbose

         When ``true``, print the current iteration to the console
         during inference.

         Default: ``false``

      .. describe:: justSample

         When ``true``, maintain an array of all samples taken. This
         is available via the ``samples`` property of the returned
         marginal distribution. ``justSample`` implies ``onlyMAP``.

         Default: ``false``

      .. describe:: onlyMAP

         When ``true``, return a delta distribution on the sampled
         value with the highest score instead of a marginal
         distribution built from all samples.

         Default: ``false``

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'incrementalMH', samples: 100, lag: 5, burn: 10, model: model});

   To maximize efficiency when inferring marginals over multiple variables, use the ``query`` table, rather than building up a list of variable values::

      var model = function() {
        var hmm = function(n, obs) {
          if (n === 0) return true;
          else {
            var prev = hmm(n-1, obs);
            var state = transition(prev);
            observation(state, obs[n]);
            query.add(n, state);
            return state;
          }
        };
        hmm(100, observed_data);
        return query;
      }
      Infer({method: 'incrementalMH', samples: 100, lag: 5, burn: 10, model: model});

   ``query`` is a write-only table which can be returned from a program (and thus marginalized). The only operation it supports is adding named values:

      .. js:function:: query.add(name, value)

         :param any name: Name of value to be added to query. Will be converted to string, as JavaScript object keys are.
         :param any value: Value to be added to query.
         :returns: undefined


SMC
---

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'SMC'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference using sequential Monte Carlo. When
   ``rejuvSteps`` is 0, this method is also known as a particle
   filter.

   The following options are supported:

      .. describe:: particles

         The number of particles to simulate.

         Default: ``100``

      .. describe:: rejuvSteps

         The number of MCMC steps to apply to each particle at each
         ``factor`` statement. With this addition, this method is
         often called a particle filter with rejuvenation.

         Default: ``0``

      .. describe:: rejuvKernel

         The MCMC kernel to use for rejuvenation. See `Kernels`_.

         Default: ``'MH'``

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'SMC', particles: 100, rejuvSteps: 5, model: model});

   By default SMC uses the prior as the importance distribution. Other
   distributions can be used by specifying :ref:`guide distributions
   <guides>`. This can be useful when you know something about the
   posterior distribution as specifying an importance distribution
   that is closer to the posterior than the prior will improve the
   statistical efficiency of inference.

Optimization
------------

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'optimize'[, ...]})

   This method performs inference by :ref:`optimizing <optimization>`
   the parameters of the guide program. The marginal distribution is a
   histogram constructed from samples drawn from the guide program
   using the optimized parameters.

   The following options are supported:

      .. describe:: samples

         The number of samples used to construct the marginal
         distribution.

         Default: ``1``

   In addition, all of the options supported by :ref:`Optimize
   <optimize>` are also supported here.

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'optimize', samples: 100, steps: 100, model: model});

Forward Sampling
----------------

.. js:function:: Infer({model: ..., method: 'forward'[, ...]})

   This method builds a histogram of return values obtained by
   repeatedly executing either the target or :ref:`guide <guides>`
   program given by ``model``.

   While the :ref:`guide <guides>` does not include ``factor``
   statements by definition, those in the target are ignored by this
   method.

   When executing the target, this method often corresponds to
   sampling from the prior of a model.

   The following options are supported:

   .. describe:: samples

      The number of samples to take.

      Default: ``1``

   .. describe:: guide

      When ``true``, execute the guide. Otherwise, execute the target.

      Default: ``false``

   .. describe:: params

      Guide program parameters. Optional, and only used when executing
      the guide program.

   Example usage::

     Infer({method: 'forward', model: model});
     Infer({method: 'forward', guide: true, params: optimizedParams, model: model});
